# Default config for tofi
#
# Copy this file to ~/.config/tofi/config and get customising!
#
# A complete reference of available options can be found in `man 5 tofi`.

#
### Fonts
#
	# Font to use, either a path to a font file or a name.
	#
	# If a path is given, tofi will startup much quicker, but any
	# characters not in the chosen font will fail to render.
	#
	# Otherwise, fonts are interpreted in Pango format.	
font = /home/bastien/.fonts/SF-Compact-Display-Light.otf

anchor = top
width = 100%
height = 26
horizontal = true
font-size = 12
prompt-text = ""
outline-width = 0

### Behaviour
#
	# Hide the mouse cursor.
	hide-cursor = false

	# Show a text cursor in the input field.
	text-cursor = false

	# Sort results by number of usages in run and drun modes.
	history = true

	# Specify an alternate file to read and store history information
	# from / to. This shouldn't normally be needed, and is intended to
	# facilitate the creation of custom modes.
	# history-file = /path/to/histfile

	# Select the matching algorithm used. If normal, substring matching is
	# used, weighted to favour matches closer to the beginning of the
	# string. If prefix, only substrings at the beginning of the string are
	# matched. If fuzzy, searching is performed via a simple fuzzy matching
	# algorithm.
	#
	# Supported values: normal, prefix, fuzzy
#matching-algorithm = fuzzy

	# If true, require a match to allow a selection to be made. If false,
	# making a selection with no matches will print input to stdout.
	# In drun mode, this is always true.
	require-match = true

	# If true, automatically accept a result if it is the only one
	# remaining. If there's only one result on startup, window creation is
	# skipped altogether.
	auto-accept-single = false

	# If true, typed input will be hidden, and what is displayed (if
	# anything) is determined by the hidden-character option.
	hide-input = false

	# Replace displayed input characters with a character. If the empty
	# string is given, input will be completely hidden.
	# This option only has an effect when hide-input is set to true.
	hidden-character = "*"

	# If true, use physical keys for shortcuts, regardless of the current
	# keyboard layout. If false, use the current layout's keys.
	#physical-keybindings = true

	# Instead of printing the selected entry, print the 1-based index of
	# the selection. This option has no effect in run or drun mode. If
	# require-match is set to false, non-matching input will still result
	# in the input being printed.
	#print-index = false

	# If true, directly launch applications on selection when in drun mode.
	# Otherwise, just print the command line to stdout.
	drun-launch = false

	# The terminal to run terminal programs in when in drun mode.
	# This option has no effect if drun-launch is set to true.
	# Defaults to the value of the TERMINAL environment variable.
	# terminal = foot

	# Delay keyboard initialisation until after the first draw to screen.
	# This option is experimental, and will cause tofi to miss keypresses
	# for a short time after launch. The only reason to use this option is
	# performance on slow systems.
	late-keyboard-init = false

	# If true, allow multiple simultaneous processes.
	# If false, create a lock file on startup to prevent multiple instances
	# from running simultaneously.
	multi-instance = false

	# Assume input is plain ASCII, and disable some Unicode handling
	# functions. This is faster, but means e.g. a search for "e" will not
	# match "Ã©".
	ascii-input = false

### Inclusion
#
	# Configs can be split between multiple files, and then included
